# Refactoring Notes

Notes from Venkat's Refactoring tech talk
---

The other day, I was listening to Venkat Subramaniam Tech Talk on Refactoring, and thought of jotting down the points that I can recollect today.

* Refactoring improves code quality. 

* Why bother improving quality, when customer doesn't sees the code? Because, one cannot be agile if the code sucks.

* Nobody can write wonderful code in one go. Code improvement (or Refactoring) is iterative in nature, and should be done collectively.

* Easier to maintain. A good software goes through more maintenance (new releases with new features).

* Programs must be written for programmers to read.

* No Comments

* Small Methods - Fit in single screen

* Simple Consice

* Dont try to write clever code

* Methods should be at different levels of abstraction. What did you do over weekend was a classy example, that explains the point precmaiesly.

* Take extremely small steps

* Frequent check-in

* Courage to throw the code and re-start.
