## Docker Swarm

* ***Docker Swarm*** is native clustering for Docker containers. It pools together several Docker Engines into a single, virtual host.
* This is more to do with actual host machines running docker (referred as Docker Engines), whereas *Docker Compose* is about the virtual container running app.
