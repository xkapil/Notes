## My Docker Notes

My Docker Notes are from the perspective of a developer (and not a DevOps). Hence, I will avoid going deep into networks, volumes etc.

* [What Is Docker](01-What-is-Docker.md)
* [Getting Started](02-Getting-Started.md)
* [Docker Compose](03-Docker-Compose.md)
* [Docker Swarm](04-Docker-Swarm.md)

Notes made on *Docker version 1.11.2, build b9f10c9*
